Aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to reduce pain, fever, and/or inflammation, and as an antithrombotic.
Specific inflammatory conditions which aspirin is used to treat include Kawasaki disease, pericarditis, and rheumatic fever.
Aspirin is also used long-term to help prevent further heart attacks, ischaemic strokes, and blood clots in people at high risk.
For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes.
Aspirin works similarly to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets.
One common adverse effect is an upset stomach.
More significant side effects include stomach ulcers, stomach bleeding, and worsening asthma.
Bleeding risk is greater among those who are older, drink alcohol, take other NSAIDs, or are on other blood thinners.
Aspirin is not recommended in the last part of pregnancy.
It is not generally recommended in children with infections because of the risk of Reye syndrome.
High doses may result in ringing in the ears.
